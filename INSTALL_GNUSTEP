Bermuda Triangle has a special support for GNUstep. You can build an app file
by typing:
  cd src
  make gnustep

Now there is a directory called "Bermuda Triangle.app" in src. You can
copy it to ~/GNUstep/Applications/ to start Bermuda Triangle by typing:
  openapp "Bermuda Triangle"

Have a lot of fun with GNUstep,
Simon
